# DeepActiveLearning

This project is an implementation of the Deep Active Learning (DeepAL) framwork from the paper Deep Active Learning based Experimental Design to Uncover Synergistic Genetic Interactions for Host Targeted Therapeutics


# Dependencies 
The required library for this project includes:
matplotlib, numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit_learn, torch, seaborn, torch-geometric. See requirements.txt for the minimal package versions.

# Setup
To set up the package as a python module run "pip install ." in terminal 

# Running the simple experiments
Step 1: Generate the simulated data which include generating
       (1) The simulated interaction matrix (up to number of replicates selected)
       (2) The simulated hetergeneous knolwedge graph 
python simulated_data.py

Step 2: Run the DeepAL framework (in terminal)
    (1) base model:
        cd scripts
        bash run.sh
    (2) ensemble model:
        cd scripts
        bash run_mp.sh
Step 3: Run the post analysis notebook (notebooks/result.ipynb)
